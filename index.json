The idea of employing an ANN signal generation model, was to add a second layer of improvement on the already over-performing stocks as implied by the market anomaly and the underlying factor strategy. The network successfully detects buy signals allowing to ‚Äúhand-pick‚Äù several stocks from an already well-performing pool of stocks. My ANN-based investment strategy systematically achieves portfolio gains (as captured by increases in risk-adjusted returns) over the benchmarks. In particularly, over the period 2009-2017, my algorithmic strategy on average increases the Sharpe ratios by 65% and triples the FF5-alphas compared to the standard overperforming low-beta factor decile portfolios (P1-P3). My best performing ANN portfolio (comprised of the 330 lowest-beta US stocks, before ‚Äúhand-picked‚Äù by the network) achieves a 126% increase, resulting a Sharpe ratio of 5, translating to a ratio of 7.7 relative to the Sharpe of the S\u0026amp;P500 with dividends reinvested.\n","date":1562716800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562716800,"objectID":"fa3e0b19fa7f606b774b3494175d7c99","permalink":"https://ckarag.github.io/project/ann_bab/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/ann_bab/","section":"project","summary":"Employing an ANN trade-direction signal generator to boost the realized returns obtained from the decile portfolios of the beta anomaly in the US equities market.","tags":["Machine Learning","Alpha"],"title":"A Trade-signal Generator for Improving Portfolio Returns of Factor Strategies","type":"project"},{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":" Create your slides in Markdown - click the Slides button to check out the example.

The Macro Monitor avoids human judgment by operating entirely on a large pool of data released by official sources.

It is fully automated and the predictions are continuously updated in real-time as soon as new data releases become available, allowing to incorporate the latest market and economic developments, hence providing the most up-to-date views for the current and future states of the economies being monitored.\nUS The graphs below show the weekly evolution of the nowcasts for the respective period, as models are updated each Friday to reflect newly released information from the preceding week.

The two methodologies are the Factor-augmented AR (FAR) methodology of Stock-Watson (2002), and the Sg-LASSO-MIDAS by Babii et al. (2022). The nowcasts at the last plot are based on the tutorial material I am teaching for the MSc course titled ‚ÄòIntro to Big Data Analytics‚Äô at KCL. In the two plots at the top, all the simplifications made in the course are dropped.\nThe dataset is made of 160 carefully selected mixed-frequency indicators, that are updated on a timely basis (i.e. every time the nowcasts are re-run). As such, the nowcasts reflect the information contained in the latest released economic and market data, as of the day of the estimation (which can be seen by hovering over the corresponding points in the plots). The mixed-frequency panel of predictors contains weekly, daily, and monthly indicators.
